# StudyBuddy — Pomodoro Study Tracker

A client-side web application for university students to track focused study sessions using the Pomodoro Technique. Built entirely in **F#** using [Fable](https://fable.io/) (F# → JavaScript compiler) and [Feliz](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Feliz) (React bindings).

## Motivation

University students often struggle with staying focused during study sessions. StudyBuddy solves this by combining a **Pomodoro timer** with **session logging** and **per-subject statistics**, so students can see exactly how much time they spend on each course and build better study habits.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer** — Configurable work/break intervals with a circular progress ring, audio notification on completion, and browser tab countdown display.
- **Subject Management** — Create, edit, and color-code your courses/subjects.
- **Session Log** — Automatic logging of completed study sessions, grouped by date, with optional notes.
- **Statistics Dashboard** — Weekly activity chart, total study time, per-subject breakdown with horizontal bar chart.
- **Persistent Storage** — All data is saved in the browser's `localStorage`; no account or backend required.
- **Responsive Design** — Mobile-first dark theme with bottom tab navigation.

- **`Storage.fs`** — `localStorage` persistence with Thoth.Json encoders/decoders
- **`Timer.fs`** — Pomodoro timer component with circular SVG progress ring
- **`SessionLog.fs`** — Study log view grouped by date
- **`Stats.fs`** — Statistics dashboard with SVG charts
- **`Settings.fs`** — Timer settings and subject management
- **`App.fs`** — Root init/update/view functions and tab navigation
- **`Main.fs`** — React entry point with timer tick subscription
